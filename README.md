# Thinkful
Thinkful Data Science Bootcamp

# Summary:
As ThinkFul Data Science mentor I felt that I should also go through the same exercises as my students. In this github repo I go through the units, lessons, and capstone projects. This is also a way for me to learn the material better as well. I insert some of my other writing and explanations for the topics.

# How this github repo works:
You'll want to have Python 3.X installed on your desktop, Juypter notebook, and most of the data science libraires as well, or you can use Anaconda. These libraires are imported at the beginning of each exercise. I am using a Windows 7, Intel 2.70 Ghz, 64-bit Operating System.
